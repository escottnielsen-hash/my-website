## A New Beginning

I'm excited to officially launch my personal website! This has been a project I've been wanting to build for a while, and it feels great to finally have it live.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a space that's truly mine — a place to share my journey as an entrepreneur, showcase my projects, and connect with people who share similar interests.

Social media is great, but having your own website gives you full control over how you present yourself and your work to the world.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Blog Posts** — Thoughts on entrepreneurship, product development, and lessons learned along the way
- **Portfolio** — A showcase of my projects and businesses
- **Resources** — Tips and tools that have helped me on my journey

## What's Next

I'll be regularly updating this site with new content, projects, and ideas. If you want to stay in the loop, bookmark this page and check back often!

Thanks for stopping by. I'm glad you're here.

— Angie
