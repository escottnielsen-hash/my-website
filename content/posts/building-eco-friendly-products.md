## It Started with a Simple Question

What if the everyday products we use could be better — better for us and better for the planet?

That question has been at the heart of everything I've built. It's easy to overlook the small things in life, like what we use to clean our homes. But those small choices add up.

## The Problem with Disposable Culture

We live in a world of single-use everything. Paper towels, plastic wipes, chemical-laden sprays — it's wasteful, expensive, and unnecessary.

I knew there had to be a better way.

## Finding the Solution

After months of research and testing, I discovered materials and designs that could replace disposable products without sacrificing quality. The result is a line of products that are:

- **Reusable** — Designed to last, not be thrown away
- **Effective** — Works as well (or better) than what you're used to
- **Thoughtfully designed** — Every detail has a purpose

## Lessons Learned

Building a product from scratch taught me more than any course ever could:

1. **Start before you're ready** — Perfection is the enemy of progress
2. **Listen to real people** — Customer feedback is gold
3. **Stay true to your values** — Don't compromise on what matters

## What's Next

I'm continuing to develop new products and refine existing ones. The goal is always the same: create something meaningful that makes daily life a little better.
