### My Mission

I'm driven by the belief that business can be a force for good. Every project I take on aims to create value while being mindful of the impact we have on the world around us.

Whether it's a cleaning cloth designed with sacred geometry or a clothing brand built on community — there's always a deeper purpose behind the work.
